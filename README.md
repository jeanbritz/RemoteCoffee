RemoteCoffee
============

My final-year project was to add a few sensors to an ordinary coffee percolator. The heating element was controlled using an opto-coupled TRIAC as the actuator. This percolator is then remotely monitored via the Trinity SMART Sight service that transmits and receives instructions via a Sierra Wireless FXT009 GSM modem which has additional custom AWTDA commands to communicate with the Trinity SMART platform.
